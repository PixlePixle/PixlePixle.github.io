## PixlePixle.github.io
Welcome! This is the repository for my [Website](https://PixlePixle.github.io).
This is a pretty simple site built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS.
I started this in my freshman year of college as a way for me to learn a bit of web development and to have somewhere I could show off my collection of projects.
